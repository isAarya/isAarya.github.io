Following is a comprehensive list of all imaging tools, software and programming languages that I have worked extensively with.


1. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> C++ </h1> </dd>
   </dl> 
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   I frequently write my own algorithms in C++. 
   This allows me to integrate my own imaging application with other imaging toolbox.
   Most of the open source toolbox have C++ as their underlying program language and hence makes it easier to contribute
   to the project.

2. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> C# </h1> </dd>
   </dl>   
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   C# allows you to write more efficient code in managed array format.
   This helps while writing your own app in .NET package. 
   C# shares similar OOP principles as C++ and hence is easier to adopt if you are familiar with C++.

3. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> MATLAB </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   MATLAB
   </font></dd>
   </dl>
      
   
4. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> Visual Studio 2010 </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   Visual Studio acts as compiler platform for most of the open-source toolbox that I use such as VTK, ITK, Open-CV etc.
   With help of C-make it is easy to build the binaries required to use these tools and use them along with Visual studio 2010.
   In addition, once can change project between software languages such as C++, .NET, F# and Windows Form etc. quite easily with help of
   VS 2010 (Visual Studio 2010) can also help to develop your own user-interactive interface for applications.

5. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> VTK </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   Visualization tool-kit (VTK) is an open-source toolbox that offers image analysis and computer vision for image data.
   It is very good for 3D image analysis and volume rendering and volume ray-cast function for visualization of the 3D image data.
   The underlying source code is in C++ and hence enables you to integrate your own imaging application with the existing VTK functions.

6. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> C++/CLI </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   C++/CLI is an interfacing function to write unmanaged C++ code into managed C# code. 
   This helps in converting your C++ application into managed C# language to be used with ASP/.Net application.
   This is offered in Visual studio 2010 and hence no additional software download required.
   </font></dd>
   </dl>
      
   
7. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> COMSOL </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   COMSOL is a multi-physics software tool-kit. It allows study of multiple physics study on 3D or stl model.
   One can generate model and couple different physics such as thermal or sound to study complex real world scenarios.
   It also helps in an easier environment for finite element model (FEM) study as compared to ANSYS.
   It works in association with SIMPLEWARE toolbox which enables modification and settings for 3D CAD models. 
   COMSOL also allows easy interface with SOLIDWORKS allowing real-time modification of the CAD model for a multi-physics study.

8. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> GitHub </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   GitHub is a software repository toolbox. It helps in version control, storage and distribution of your software tool or imaging application.
   </font></dd>

9. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> Docker </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   Docker is software toolbox which enables to write your application in a container. This allows you to run your application independent of the OS of the user.
