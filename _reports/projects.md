Following is a list of all my projects.

1. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> Software tool & GUI: </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   A software application for 3D image processing, modelling and computer vision.
   The aim of this tool is for analysis of 3D images using knee MRI for Osteoarthritis assessment.
   The application consists of wavelet widget using 3D un-decimated wavelets and imaging of 3D cartilage model.

2. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> Patient specific RF ablation study with FEM model for breast cancer: </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   This project focused on FEM study of radio-frequency (RF) ablation study for breast tumour.
   It investigated the bio-thermal distribution of heat and electrical conductivity of cancerous and non-cancerous tissue.
   It also studied size of tumour and ablation characteristics of a novel RF electrode.

3. <dl>
   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> EMG monitoring device: </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   This project is based on design and development of an EMG monitoring device. The project looked at circuit design
   and device development with EMG electrodes and visualization of signal on oscilloscope. In addition it also implemented 
   signal filtering and amplification within medical specifications for device development.

   <dd> <h1 style="color:#7d1b7e;"> CAIsr website: </h1> </dd>
   </dl>
   <dl>
   <dd> <font size="4">
   A static website for Centre for Advanced Imaging (CAI), University of Queensland was built to demonstrate
   imaging tools, workflows and research studies at CAI. The website was built with Jekyll and hosted on GitHub.
