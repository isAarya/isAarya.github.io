Hi there,

I am a biomedical-engineer with interest in image analysis and computer vision.

I also have an interest in design of non-invasive and minimally invasive technologies for medical devices.

I like to develop to novel imaging tools that can help achieve better diagnosis and image analysis.

I am currently based in Queensland, Australia.
